## Rosalind
[Rosalind][1] is a website similar to Project Euler or Rosetta Code, only centered around bioinformatics. There are many algorithm-related problems, focusing on different areas of computer science (dynamic programming, graph algorithms etc).

This is the place where I post my solutions of the problems I manage to solve. They are commented and contain links to the exercises, even a short description. Sometimes I find a cool solution on Rosalind and also include it in the file - as a future reference, and also to point out my beginner mistakes and show different approaches to a given problem.

And I'll be doing all of those in Haskell, as that is the language I'm currently learning.

## Current progress
You can see some detailed stats on my [Rosalind profile][2]. The number of problems I've solved is now **19**.
